### The tentative project title:

Dog Bite Analysis in NYC

### The motivation for this project

The phenomenon of dog bite seems to be uncommon nowadays, which might
make some people be afraid of dogs. In addition, the severe consequence
of dog bite such as physical injuries and potential diseases has aroused
wide public concern. This project is designed to analyze potential
associated indicators for the dog bite.

The three datasets have a common variable: borough. Therefore, we will
use three histograms to show the counts of dog licenses, dog bite, and
dog run based on the boroughs separately. We will also analyze the data
with the different policies in different areas, i.e. off-leash vs. dog
run.

We make a pie chart to show the proportions of different genders in the
biting dogs and another one to show the proportions of different breeds.
Thus we can analyze if the dog bite is associated with gender and breed.
