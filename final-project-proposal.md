final project proposal
================

The three datasets have a common variable: borough. Therefore, we will
use three histograms to show the counts of dog licenses, dog bite, and
dog run based on the boroughs separately. We will also analyze the data
with the different policies in different areas, i.e. off-leash vs. dog
run.
